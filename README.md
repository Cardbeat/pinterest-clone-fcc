Objective: Build a Glitch app that is functionally similar to this: https://wild-song.glitch.me.
Fulfill the below user stories. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
- [x] As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub. 
  
- [ ] As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
  
- [ ] As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
  
- [ ] As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
  
- [ ] As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
  
- [ ] As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
